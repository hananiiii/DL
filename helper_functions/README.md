<!-- "PyTorch-based implementation of a custom image dataset loader, replicating the behavior of torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder. It is designed to help understand how datasets and dataloaders work in PyTorch by manually implementing key steps such as:

Reading image paths from class-based folder structures

Automatically mapping class names to numerical labels

Returning image–label pairs in a format compatible with PyTorch models

Supporting transformations (e.g., resizing, normalization, data augmentation)

🎯 Purpose
This project is ideal for learners who want to:

Understand how PyTorch datasets and dataloaders function internally

Customize their own data loading pipeline

Experiment with image classification tasks using real data

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

PyTorch

Torchvision (for comparison)

PIL (for image loading)

pathlib (for file paths)

Custom classes & transforms" -->
